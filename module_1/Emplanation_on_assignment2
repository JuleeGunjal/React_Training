   JavaScript is synchronous, blocking and single-threaded. This means that the JavaScript engine executes our program sequentially, one line at a time from top to bottom in the exact order of the statements.It processes our script line by line. Until a current task is completed, the next task cannot begin.
   In case of script added in head or above the element to be accessed No change of content happened.
   The body element weâ€™re trying to call will not exist during the execution of the script. We can either move the <script> tag towards the closing <body> tag (same as in third case).
